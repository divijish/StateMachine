# StateMachine
A simple <b>deterministic finite state machine</b> implementation in java.

There are two state machine AState and BState, both take inputs 'a' and 'b'.
On receiving input as 'a', AState remains in the same state, but on receiving 'b', it switches to BState.
Similarly, on receiving input as 'b', BState remains in the same state, but on receiving 'a', it switches to AState.
